# WebLaTeX
The repository contains a Spring Boot web application which allows generating LaTeX formulas as png files.

In order to launch the application it is enough to compile it as a Maven project (just execute **mvn package**) and run the built jar file. You can then hit <http://localhost:8080> or <http://localhost:8080/weblatex>.
